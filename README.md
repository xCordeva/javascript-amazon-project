# Amazon-Clone E-commerce Project

This web application is designed to replicate the user experience of a popular online shopping platform, Amazon. While the foundational HTML and CSS components are not mine but are from a tutorial by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev), the functionality, interactivity, and dynamic behavior have been implemented in JavaScript by me.
